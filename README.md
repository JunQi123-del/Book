Activating the venv with:

Mac: venv/bin/activate
Windows: venv/bin/activate

TODO later:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
(Will save the depenedencies into requirements.txt so for others to easily install dependencies and run)

run the web server with:
python manage.py runserver

The webserver would be running locally on port 8000. http://127.0.0.1:8000
